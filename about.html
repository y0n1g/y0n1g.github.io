I am y0n1g, a worker clicking keyboard everyday.<br>
y0n1g,每天的工作是敲电脑.<br>

#### What can you get from here? / 你可以看到什么? 
This will be my personal blogging area. I happened to get to know something aobut git, jekyll, etc., and found that with GitHub a personal blog system could be established easily without the risk to be blocked by the "magic" wall. So I decide to take a try here.<br>
这将是我的个人Blog. 最近看到了git,jekyll等内容,发现可以用GitHub架设自己的blog,而且可以长期保存,同时github短期内看
不到被墙的风险. 所以我也凑一凑热闹.

I plan to put here the staff like the notes of the books I read, technical materials, etc. Wishing it could bring any useful tips to you. enjoy! But please keep in mind to use them at your own risk, if there is any.<br>
我打算在这里放置读书笔记, 成长心得, 技术积累 等各种内容. 如果内容能对你有一点益处, 我将很开心. 有谬误,请指教; 但我对内容的准确性不负责.
